# Stacks and Queues
Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a Stack and a Queue

## Challenge
Can successfully push onto a stack
Can successfully push multiple values onto a stack
Can successfully pop off the stack
Can successfully empty a stack after multiple pops
Can successfully peek the next item on the stack
Can successfully instantiate an empty stack
Calling pop or peek on empty stack raises exception
Can successfully enqueue into a queue
Can successfully enqueue multiple values into a queue
Can successfully dequeue out of a queue the expected value
Can successfully peek into a queue, seeing the expected value
Can successfully empty a queue after multiple dequeues
Can successfully instantiate an empty queue
Calling dequeue or peek on empty queue raises exception

## Approach & Efficiency
same approach I used for linked lists since they are very similar

## Whiteboard
