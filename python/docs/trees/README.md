# Trees
Create a binary tree and binary search tree method

## Challenge
Can successfully instantiate an empty tree
Can successfully instantiate a tree with a single root node
For a Binary Search Tree, can successfully add a left child and right child properly to a node
Can successfully return a collection from a preorder traversal
Can successfully return a collection from an inorder traversal
Can successfully return a collection from a postorder traversal
Returns true	false for the contains method, given an existing or non-existing node value

## Approach & Efficiency
I took an iterative approach
