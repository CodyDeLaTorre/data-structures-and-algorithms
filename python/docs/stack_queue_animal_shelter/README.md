The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.

## Challenge
Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats.
The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.
Implement the following methods:
enqueue
Arguments: animal
animal can be either a dog or a cat object.
dequeue
Arguments: pref
pref can be either "dog" or "cat"
Return: either a dog or a cat, based on preference.
If pref is not "dog" or "cat" then return null.

## Approach & Efficiency
same approach I used for linked lists since they are very similar
